# Metabolome-analysis
Some R scripts to collect the metabolite info from public database.

The HMDB used in the Chemical_taxonomic_analysis.R should be downloaded from https://hmdb.ca/ prior to running the code.

Please make the input file like the Input-Sample_SignificantMeatboltes.csv. The second column of metabolite names is neccessary, while other columns are optional.

Please run the Chemical_taxonomic_analysis.R first, then use the RData to continue the Collect_metabolite_ko.R.
